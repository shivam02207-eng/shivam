Unit-2 Assignement
Main problem — group 
G
=
{
e
,
a
,
b
,
c
}
G={e,a,b,c} with table
Operation table (given) — reproduced briefly for clarity:

∗	e	a	b	c
e	e	a	b	c
a	a	e	c	b
b	b	c	e	a
c	c	b	a	e
1. Verify whether 
(
G
,
∗
)
(G,∗) is a group
Closure: every product in table is in 
{
e
,
a
,
b
,
c
}
{e,a,b,c} → closed.

Identity: 
e
e acts as identity (row/column for 
e
e returns each element) → identity exists.

Inverses: from table 
a
∗
a
=
e
a∗a=e, 
b
∗
b
=
e
b∗b=e, 
c
∗
c
=
e
c∗c=e and 
e
e is its own inverse. So each element has inverse (each non-identity element is its own inverse).

Associativity: For finite small groups given by a Cayley table, once closure, identity and inverses hold and table is consistent with a known group structure (see comment below), associativity holds. Concretely, this table matches the Klein four group 
V
4
V 
4

  (the group 
Z
2
×
Z
2
Z 
2

 ×Z 
2

 ), which is associative. Therefore associativity holds.

Conclusion: 
(
G
,
∗
)
(G,∗) is a group (in fact isomorphic to the Klein four group 
V
4
V 
4

 ).

2. Is the group abelian?
Check symmetry of table: entry 
a
∗
b
=
c
a∗b=c and 
b
∗
a
=
c
b∗a=c; similarly for others. The table is symmetric, so 
x
∗
y
=
y
∗
x
x∗y=y∗x for all 
x
,
y
x,y.
Thus the group is abelian.

3. All subgroups of 
G
G
Subgroups must contain identity and be closed. Because each nonidentity has order 2, the subgroups are:

{
e
}
{e} (trivial)

{
e
,
a
}
{e,a}

{
e
,
b
}
{e,b}

{
e
,
c
}
{e,c}

{
e
,
a
,
b
,
c
}
=
G
{e,a,b,c}=G

(Those three order-2 subgroups are all the 2-element subgroups.)

4. Order of each element
∣
e
∣
=
1
∣e∣=1

∣
a
∣
=
2
∣a∣=2 because 
a
2
=
e
a 
2
 =e

∣
b
∣
=
2
∣b∣=2

∣
c
∣
=
2
∣c∣=2

5. Using this group operation for a simple encryption scheme
One simple model (symmetric-key):

Map plaintext alphabet (or plaintext blocks) to group elements 
{
e
,
a
,
b
,
c
}
{e,a,b,c}.

Key = a group element 
k
∈
G
k∈G.

Encryption of message 
m
∈
G
m∈G: 
E
k
(
m
)
=
k
∗
m
E 
k

 (m)=k∗m.

Decryption: 
D
k
(
c
)
=
k
−
1
∗
c
D 
k

 (c)=k 
−1
 ∗c. Since 
k
−
1
=
k
k 
−1
 =k for non-identity here (order 2), decryption is same operation: 
D
k
(
c
)
=
k
∗
c
D 
k

 (c)=k∗c.
Properties:

Simple and fast.

If plaintext mapping is known and key space is tiny (4 keys), insecure in practice — but illustrates group-based symmetric encryption.

Because group is abelian and involutive (elements self-inverse), encryption and decryption are identical operations with the same key.

Sub-Problem 1 — Homomorphism & Isomorphism
The assignment asks: Show that H forms a group under multiplication. The file didn't explicitly give H’s elements; a common illustrative choice is 
H
=
{
1
,
−
1
}
H={1,−1} under multiplication (a standard small subgroup). I’ll show that example and then state the general idea.

Example: 
H
=
{
1
,
−
1
}
H={1,−1} under multiplication
Closure: 
1
⋅
1
=
1
,
 
1
⋅
(
−
1
)
=
−
1
,
 
(
−

)
⋅
(
−
1
)
=
1
1⋅1=1, 1⋅(−1)=−1, (−1)⋅(−1)=1 — all in 
H
H.

Identity: 
1
1 is identity.

Inverse:

Associativity: multiplication is associative in 
R

H

Thus 
H
H is a group (in fact isomorphic to 
Z

 ).

Importance of isomorphisms in cryptographic transformations
Isomorphism = structure-preserving bijection between groups. If 
G
≅
H
G≅H, algorithms and protocols using group operations can be transferred across groups via the isomorphism.

In crypto, isomorphisms allow moving problems to groups where they are easier to compute (or safer): e.g., represent group elements in different encodings, or use isomorphic groups for efficient arithmetic while preserving algebraic hardness.

They help analyze security: an isomorphism to a well-understood group can show an algorithm’s behavior or reveal weaknesses.

Sub-Problem 2 — Rings, Integral Domains, Fields ( 
R
=
Z
6
R=Z 
6

  )
We work modulo 6.

(a) Is 
R
=
Z
6
R=Z 
6

  a ring?
Yes. 
Z
6
Z 
6

  with addition and multiplication mod 6 satisfies:

(
Z
6
,
+
)
(Z 
6

 ,+) is an abelian group.

Multiplication is associative and distributive over addition modulo 6.
Therefore 
Z
6
Z 
6

  is a ring (a commutative ring with unity 
1
1).

(b) Is 
Z
6
Z 
6

  an integral domain?
No. Integral domain requires no zero divisors. In 
Z
6
Z 
6

 : 
2
⋅
3
≡
0
(
m
o
d
6
)
2⋅3≡0(mod6) while neither 2 nor 3 is 0 mod 6. So zero divisors exist → not an integral domain.

(c) Is 
Z
6
Z 
6

  a field?
No. A field requires every nonzero element to have a multiplicative inverse. In 
Z
6
Z 
6

 , e.g., 2 has no inverse mod 6. So not a field.

Which 
Z
n
Z 
n

  is a field? Exactly when 
n
n is prime. So choose 
n
=
p
n=p prime — e.g., 
Z
5
Z 
5

  is a field.

Sub-Problem 3 — Applications of Group Theory
(a) Definition & real-world example of cyclic group
Cyclic group: A group generated by a single element 
g
g; every element is 
g
k
g 
k
  for some integer 
k
k.

Example: 
(
Z
n
,
+
)
(Z 
n

 ,+) is cyclic generated by 1 (or any element coprime to 
n
n). Real-world: modular arithmetic used in clock arithmetic and many crypto protocols (e.g., working in multiplicative subgroup of integers modulo a prime).

(b) 
G
=
Z
10
G=Z 
10

 . Identify all generators
Generators are elements whose order is 10, i.e., integers 
k
k with 
gcd
⁡
(
k
,
10
)
=
1
gcd(k,10)=1. Those are:

1
,
3
,
7
,
9
1,3,7,9.
So 
1
,
3
,
7
,
9
1,3,7,9 generate 
Z
10
Z 
10

 .

(c) How group theory simplifies Diffie–Hellman
Diffie–Hellman uses exponentiation in a cyclic group 
G
=
⟨
g
⟩
G=⟨g⟩.

Each party picks secret exponent 
a
a, computes 
g
a
g 
a
 , exchanges values, and computes shared key 
g
a
b
g 
ab
 . Group properties (closure, associativity, existence of inverses) ensure correctness and that both compute same key.

Group structure isolates the algebraic properties used (discrete log hardness) and lets designers choose groups with desirable security/performance characteristics (prime-order subgroups, elliptic curve groups, etc.)

Sub-Problem 4 — Combinatorial Optimization
(a) Routes to visit 4 cities
If the truck must visit all 4 cities and order matters, number of permutations = 
4
!
=
24
4!=24 possible routes.

(If route is a round-trip and starting city fixed, unique tours = 
(
4
−
1
)
!
=
6
(4−1)!=6.)

(b) Greedy algorithm & MST example
Greedy algorithm: Make the locally optimal choice at each step hoping to reach a global optimum.

MST example (Prim’s algorithm):

Start at any vertex.

Repeatedly add the smallest-weight edge that connects a vertex in the tree to a vertex outside, avoiding cycles.

Continue until all vertices included.
This greedy choice produces a Minimum Spanning Tree.

(c) Knapsack problem & combinatorics
0/1 Knapsack: Given items with weights and values, maximize total value subject to weight capacity. Combinatorics helps enumerate/estimate possible item subsets; dynamic programming uses combinatorial structure (subproblem overlap) to find optimal solution efficiently for moderate sizes. Approximation and combinatorial bounds guide heuristics.

Sub-Problem 5 — Discrete Probability
(a) Die roll
Sample space 
S
=
{
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
,
5
,
6
}
S={1,2,3,4,5,6}.

Event “even number” 
E
=
{
2
,
4
,
6
}
E={2,4,6}.

Compute (fair die, equally likely outcomes):

P
(
odd
)
=
P
(
{
1
,
3

5
}
)
=

P(odd)=P({1,3,5})=3/6=

P

=
P
(
{

)

.
P(number>3)=P({4,5,6})=3/6= 
2

 .

P
(

P(prime number): primes in 1–6 are 
{
2
,

{2,3,5} →

(b) Two cards drawn without replacement (standard 52-card deck)
Both kings: Number of ways choose 2 kings = 
(
4
2
)
=
6
( 
2
4

 )=6. Total ways choose any 2 cards = 
(
52
2
)
=
1326
( 
2
52

 )=1326.
So 
P
(
both kings
)
=
6
1326
=
1
221
≈
0.00452.
P(both kings)= 
1326
6

 = 
221

 ≈0.00452.

First a heart, second a spade (without replacement):
P
(
first heart
)
=
13
/
52
=
1
/
4.
P(first heart)=13/52=1/4.
Given first was heart, remaining deck has 51 cards with 13 spades still. So 
P
(
second spade
∣
first heart
)
=
13
/
51.
P(second spade∣first heart)=13/51.
Multiply: 
P
=

⋅
13

=

≈
0.0637.
P=

 =

 ≈0.0637.

Sub-Problem 6 — Conditional Probability & Bayes’ Theorem
Problem: System identifies spam with 95% accuracy; 20% of emails are spam. Find 
P
(
actually spam
∣
marked spam
)
P(actually spam∣marked spam).

Interpretation used: “95% accuracy” we treat as true positive rate = 0.95 and true negative rate = 0.95 (i.e., false positive rate = 0.05). Then use Bayes’ rule.

Let:

S
S = email is spam, 
P
(
S
)
=
0.20
P(S)=0.20.

M
M = system marks email as spam.

P
(
M
∣
S
)
=
0.95
P(M∣S)=0.95, 
P
(
M
∣
S
c
)
=
0.05
P(M∣S 
c
 )=0.05.

Bayes:

P
(
